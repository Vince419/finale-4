            Step 1
        </h1>
        <div class="PS1-1" style="padding: 5px;">
            The first step to emulating PS1 games on PC is to download Duckstation, the emulator 
            for PS1 games. go to <a href="https://www.thegreatestintellect.com/" 
            target="_blank">https://www.thegreatestintellect.com/</a> and follow the instruction to download Duckstation.
            You will also need to download the BIOS files which you can do just by looking up "PS1 BIOS files" on a search engine.
        </div>
        <h1>
            Step 2
        </h1>
        <div class="PS1-2">
            once you have the BIOS place them inside the PS1 BIOS folder in the duckstation files. Then open the application
            and set it up. you'll see a couple screens where you can just press but for some you have to do stuff but the 
            application will tell you what to do.
        </div>
<h1>
            Step 3
        </h1>
    <div class="PS1-3" style="padding: 5px;">
       Lastly you need to get the game ROMS. just search something similar to "PS1 game ROMS" on a search engine and you should find
       them. make sure to extract the ROMS once you have them and then make a folder to put all of them in since you need that to use
       Duckstation. From there your done. you can tweak game settings as you please.
